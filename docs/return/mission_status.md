# Return Mission Implementation Status

Date: 2026-10-08

## Current checkpoint

Latest corrective checkpoint: staging admission survives sensor holds without
authorising motion, and the front feed/preview stops after outbound exit then
resumes with an explicit orange-mask window. 175 regressions, a failed-position
map check and a targeted return-to-landing Gazebo flight passed. See
[sensor_hold_fix.md](sensor_hold_fix.md). The complete
initial-QR-to-landing success recorded below predates this correction; that
entire flight was not repeated. Pi/hardware timing remains unmeasured.

## Implemented

- Default full-mission continuation after matching QR descent and a five-second continuous settled hold.
- The same live field map, red evidence, residence timer, camera-pose matching and command supervisor are retained during return.
- Bounded ascent to 10 m, checked goal/frontier routing, entrance-lane survey at 10 m, return to a front-camera stand-off and acquisition-height descent.
- Orange detection reuses the existing lightweight banner detector with a separate configurable colour profile.
- Camera approach proposals pass through field freshness, stopping-region and red-map checks.
- Narrow configured mouth admission replaces the field-only inset only during an explicitly authorized approach. It is not a global fence bypass.
- Positive repeated LiDAR wall-readiness, fresh read-owner handback and a new native corridor FSM instance for the return lap.
- Role-specific second corridor exit leading to exterior egress and normal FC LAND.
- Expected LAND/disarm distinguished from pilot takeover; completion requires fresh on-ground/disarmed feedback, low measured motion and low HOME-relative altitude.
- QR decoder released after match; no repeat QR search or sweep scheduler work.
- Return yaw is rate-limited below the projection angular-rate gate; safety HOLD retains the return heading. Invalid supervision stops yaw as well as translation.
- Return corridor faults cannot authorize an unverified landing underneath the roof. The ordinary abort stops output and requires the FC/operator contingency.
- Existing coverage-only and QR-only test endpoints remain explicit options.

## Additional geometry finding

A lower-altitude forward approach cannot necessarily see enough new ground to certify the existing 0.70 m clearance envelope: the configured downward footprint shrinks with altitude. Return first surveys the entrance lane from a safe interior viewpoint at 10 m, then backs out to the acquisition stand-off. This retains actual observations for the lower approach and avoids reducing clearance or assuming unobserved ground is clear.

Replay uses synthetic planar observations and a modest actuator lag. It proves map/routing contracts, not camera rendering, real dynamics or physical safety. No freshness, pose-integrity, target-alignment or speed threshold was relaxed to bypass the retained failures. The second failure was fixed by preserving heading authority and limiting return yaw, then proving the return-only fixture before repeating the full mission. Test processes were stopped after the successful full flight.

The full flight validates the current fixture. The existing specialized obstacle controller is reused; this pass does not claim a new reverse-direction physical obstacle-shape matrix or arbitrary landing-site certification.

## Desktop timing evidence

Across 3,227 logged return-worker samples in the full flight, processing time was median 1.341 ms, p95 7.795 ms and maximum 31.901 ms. These are desktop worker measurements, not Pi benchmarks, not the front-controller's separate readiness-fit cost, and not end-to-end exposure-to-actuation latency.

## Running the mission

From the repository root, use the owned-process harness:

```bash
python3 -m simulation.integration.qr_gazebo_validation \
  --return-mission --gui \
  --output simulation/integration/artifacts/return_manual_01 \
  --seconds 1000
```

Use a fresh output directory. The harness refuses an occupied SITL TCP port and stops only its own process groups; it does not kill unrelated user sessions. The seconds value is an execution watchdog, not a competition mission-time optimization.

Independent return evaluation, after a completed run:

```bash
python3 -m coverage_mission.evaluate_return_run \
  simulation/integration/artifacts/return_manual_01
```

For a shorter return-only fixture with fresh autonomous takeoff (not a permissive restart of the normal mission):

```bash
python3 -m simulation.integration.qr_gazebo_validation \
  --scenario return-entry --gui \
  --output simulation/integration/artifacts/return_entry_manual_01 \
  --seconds 700
```

The hidden manager fixture flag requires the owned harness environment and the registered stand-off position. Normal launches still require the initial QR and matching target before return.

The harness without `--return-mission` deliberately preserves the earlier QR-only endpoint. Direct manager launches default to the return mission; `--qr-only` stops at the matched 5 m hold and `--coverage-only` retains the coverage regression profile.

## Configuration and deployment limits

`config/return_mission.json` supplies replaceable local N/E entrance coordinates, heading, stand-off, orange thresholds and landing distance. Additional conservative limits live in the validated `ReturnConfig` defaults and can be supplied in the JSON.

The entrance/exterior strip and final landing region are surveyed-clear Gazebo operating envelopes. They require site registration and a verified flat clear landing region before physical use. They do not override a whole-mission geofence.

Camera HSV/FOV calibration, real timing/latency, LiDAR mounting/returns, as-built clearance, Pi dual-camera throughput/thermal behaviour and FC LAND/failsafe tests remain hardware/site work. No AI model or dense reconstruction was added.

The current milestone uses the orange return banner, a five-second delivery surrogate and exterior landing. Payload release and exact-home landing are not implemented.
